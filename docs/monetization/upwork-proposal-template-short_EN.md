Hi [Client name],

I can help you **organize and batch-rename files locally (offline)** and deliver a clean, auditable rename plan you can review before anything changes.

**What I’ll deliver**
- A small, offline tool (runs in your browser) to:
  - import a folder (when supported) or use a safe local workflow
  - preview old → new names before downloading anything
  - export a **CSV rename manifest** (and/or **Copy CSV**) for approvals and record-keeping
  - optionally download renamed files as a ZIP (with a fully-offline Lite fallback if ZIP isn’t available)
- Clear steps for Windows (including a one-command localhost quickstart when needed)

**Why this approach works**
- **Privacy-first:** your files stay on your machine.
- **Reversible workflow:** you review the preview/CSV first; no “silent renames”.
- **Practical for teams:** the CSV manifest is easy to share with stakeholders.

**A few quick questions**
1) Roughly how many files and what types (photos, PDFs, mixed)?
2) What rules do you need (prefix/suffix, numbering, find/replace, date patterns, etc.)?
3) Any constraints (keep original order, avoid duplicates, reserved characters, max filename length)?

**Acceptance criteria (example)**
- Given a sample set, I produce a preview and CSV where 100% of filenames match the agreed rules.
- No duplicates after renaming; invalid characters handled safely.
- You can run it on Windows without extra installs beyond a browser (and Node only if you want localhost mode).

If you share 10–20 sample filenames (no file content needed), I’ll propose the exact rename rules and confirm the workflow before we proceed.

Best,
[Your name]
