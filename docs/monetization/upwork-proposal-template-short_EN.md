Hi [Client name],

I can help you **batch rename / organize files** and deliver a clean, reproducible result. I use an **offline workflow** (your files don’t need to be uploaded to third-party services), and I can provide a clear CSV manifest so you can review the mapping before anything is finalized.

## What you’ll get
- **Renamed / reorganized files** (ZIP or structured folder)
- **CSV manifest**: `old name -> new name` (for approval + audit)
- **Rules summary** (the exact rename logic I applied so it can be repeated)

## How I work (fast + safe)
1) You share **10–30 sample filenames** (or a small sample folder) plus your desired naming format.
2) I run a **dry run** and send you the CSV mapping first.
3) After you confirm, I export the final ZIP/folder + final CSV + rules summary.

## What I need from you (copy/paste)
1) Examples of current names (5–30 lines are enough)
2) Examples of desired names (or a naming rule description)
3) Constraints:
   - keep extensions? (usually yes)
   - numbering rules? (e.g., `001`, `002`, ...)
   - forbidden characters? (Windows/macOS safe?)
   - keep folder structure or flatten?

## Optional: fixed-price packages
If you prefer a fixed scope, I can propose **Basic / Standard / Premium** packages (based on file count and complexity).

## A couple of quick questions
- Do you want **strict formatting** (exact case/underscores/dashes), or “best effort” cleanup?
- If two files would become the same name, should I **append numbers** (`(1)`, `(2)`) or use another rule?

If you paste 5–30 current filenames and the target format, I’ll reply with a proposed mapping and the quickest path to completion.
