# Upwork Proposal Template (Offline File Organizer)

> Purpose: a copy‑paste proposal you can quickly adapt when bidding on Upwork jobs like **bulk rename / organize files / deliver ZIP + CSV manifest**.
> 
> Keep it honest and platform‑compliant: do **not** ask clients to pay outside Upwork.

## 1) Short (3–5 sentences)

Hi! I can help you batch‑rename/organize your files locally (nothing uploaded) and deliver:
- the renamed files (ZIP)
- a CSV manifest (old name → new name)
- a quick summary of the rules used

If you share a few sample filenames + your naming rules, I can confirm an exact turnaround.

---

## 2) Standard (recommended)

Hi! I can handle your file cleanup efficiently using an **offline batch workflow**.

**What I’ll deliver**
- Renamed/organized files (ZIP)
- CSV manifest (old → new)
- The exact rename rules used (so it’s reproducible)

**What I need from you**
1) A sample of 10–30 filenames (or a small sample folder)
2) Your target naming format (examples are perfect)
3) Any constraints (keep original order? preserve extensions? numbering rules?)

**Notes**
- Everything can be done locally; I don’t need access to your accounts.
- I’ll run a “dry run” first and send the CSV for approval before finalizing (optional).

If you want, paste 5–10 example names + the desired output, and I’ll propose the exact mapping.

## 3) Questions checklist

- Do you want **strict** formatting (exact case, underscores, dashes), or “best effort”?
- Should duplicates be resolved by numbering (e.g., `name (1)`, `name (2)`), or by timestamps?
- Any forbidden characters (Windows / macOS compatibility)?
- Keep folder structure or flatten into one folder?
- Preferred output: ZIP only, or ZIP + separate CSV + rules summary?

## 4) Deliverables checklist (copy into your proposal)

- [ ] Rename rules confirmed
- [ ] Dry run CSV provided
- [ ] Final ZIP exported
- [ ] CSV manifest exported
- [ ] Quick summary included
