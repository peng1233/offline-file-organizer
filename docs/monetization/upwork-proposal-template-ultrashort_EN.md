Hi [Client name],

I can help you **organize and batch‑rename files locally (offline)** and deliver a clear rename plan you can approve before anything changes.

**What you get**
- A small tool that runs in your browser (privacy‑first: files stay on your machine)
- Preview **old → new** names before downloading
- Export a **CSV rename manifest** (and/or **Copy CSV**) for review/record‑keeping
- Optional ZIP download, with a fully‑offline **Lite** fallback if ZIP isn’t available
- Windows quickstart if you need localhost mode

**Quick questions**
1) How many files and what types (photos/PDFs/mixed)?
2) What rename rules (prefix/suffix, numbering, find/replace, date pattern)?
3) Any constraints (order, duplicates, reserved characters, max length)?

If you paste 10–20 sample filenames (no file content), I’ll confirm the rules and workflow first.

Best,
[Your name]
