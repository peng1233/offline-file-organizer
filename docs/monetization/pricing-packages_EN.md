# Pricing & Packages (Reference)

> Purpose: a simple, copy-friendly reference for defining Fiverr/Upwork packages for this repo’s **offline file organizing / batch renaming** service.
> 
> Note: adjust numbers/prices to your time and risk. Keep scope explicit to avoid disputes.

## Package structure (suggested)

### Basic (small cleanup)
- **Up to 200 files** (or 1 folder)
- **1 rename rule**
- Output: renamed files + **CSV manifest** (old → new)
- Turnaround: 24–48h (depending on your queue)

### Standard (typical gig)
- **Up to 1,000 files**
- Up to **2 rules** (or multiple folders)
- Output: renamed files + CSV + **ZIP delivery**
- Optional: basic folder organization

### Premium (complex / large)
- **Up to 5,000 files** (or agree on a custom cap)
- Complex rules (exceptions / multiple folders)
- Output: renamed files + CSV + ZIP + **pre-check report**
  - duplicates
  - invalid characters
  - collision risks

---

## Add-ons (upsells)
- Extra rename rules / exception list
- “Before/after” summary report
- Additional folders / additional file count
- Dry-run on a sample subset + confirmation

---

## Scope checklist (copy/paste)
- What counts as a “file” (includes subfolders?)
- Confirm: **filename only** changes (no content changes)
- Confirm: how duplicates/collisions are handled (suffix, skip, or ask)
- Delivery method: Fiverr attachment / cloud link / split ZIPs
