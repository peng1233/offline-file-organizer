# Publishing checklist (Upwork / Fiverr / Toptal)

This is a **copy/paste-friendly** checklist for publishing your service page without missing key items.

> Safety note: **Do not submit the final publish / final proposal / final gig** until you manually review it (platform rules, pricing, and any personal information).

## 1) Pick ONE platform first (single-thread validation)
- [ ] Upwork
- [ ] Fiverr
- [ ] Toptal

## 2) Choose ONE page type
- [ ] Upwork: proposal for a specific job
- [ ] Fiverr: gig listing
- [ ] Toptal: profile / application materials

## 3) Core copy (from this repo)
- [ ] Service description (short EN): `docs/marketplace/service-description-short_EN.md`
- [ ] One-pager (short EN): `docs/marketplace/one-pager-short_EN.md`
- [ ] Pricing reference: `docs/monetization/pricing-packages_EN.md`
- [ ] Proposal templates (Upwork):
  - 300–600 words: `docs/monetization/upwork-proposal-template-short_EN.md`
  - 150–250 words: `docs/monetization/upwork-proposal-template-mini_EN.md`

## 4) Proof / demo material
- [ ] Add 1 screenshot (or GIF) showing:
  - the rename rules UI
  - preview before/after names
  - the download output (ZIP or Lite download)
- [ ] If your console cannot display UTF-8 properly on Windows/PowerShell, use:
  - `docs/windows-quickstart.md`
  - `scripts/print-utf8.ps1`

## 5) Scope / deliverables (avoid disputes)
- [ ] Put a clear acceptance checklist:
  - `docs/marketplace/project-scope-template.md`
- [ ] Clarify privacy/offline:
  - “Client files stay local, no uploads.”

## 6) Final review (before you click submit)
- [ ] No prohibited claims (guaranteed income, fake reviews, etc.)
- [ ] No sensitive data (tokens, passwords, private keys)
- [ ] Compliance with platform rules (especially contact / payment rules)
- [ ] Prices match your time cost
- [ ] The text is readable (no mojibake / U+FFFD replacement characters)

## 7) Optional: sponsor/donation links
- [ ] GitHub Sponsors: https://github.com/sponsors/peng1233
- [ ] BTC donation page: https://peng1233.github.io/btc-receive/
