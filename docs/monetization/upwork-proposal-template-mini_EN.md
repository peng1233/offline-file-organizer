# Upwork Proposal (Mini, 150–250 words) — Offline File Organizer / Local Automation

> Copy-paste template. Replace [brackets]. Keep it short, specific, and easy to scan.

Hi [Client name],

I can help you **organize and automate your offline files locally** (Windows) — without sending your data to the cloud.

**What I’ll deliver**
- A working script/tool to [goal: organize files / rename / dedupe / sort / export CSV]
- Clear run steps (PowerShell/EXE) + a small README
- A short demo (screenshots/GIF) and basic error handling

**How I’ll do it (fast + safe)**
1) I review 10–30 sample filenames/folders (or a mock dataset).
2) I confirm rules (naming, folder structure, duplicates, exceptions).
3) I implement + test on your samples, then package it so you can run it anytime.

**Timeline**
- Basic version: [1 day / 2 days]
- Polished + edge cases: [3–5 days]

If you share a few examples (redacted is fine), I’ll reply with a concrete plan + a fixed-price quote (Basic/Standard/Premium).

Best,
[Your name]
