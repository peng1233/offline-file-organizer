# docs/assets

This folder is for demo screenshots and GIFs referenced by:
- docs/marketplace/demo-assets-checklist.md
- docs/marketplace/demo-assets-checklist-en.md

Guidelines:
- Keep files small and web-friendly (prefer 900-1200px width for GIFs).
- Do not record private file paths, personal data, or confidential filenames.
- Use stable filenames so marketplace copy can link to them.

Suggested filenames (from the checklist):
- lite-demo-rename-csv.gif
- main-demo-rename-download.gif
- lite-demo-hero.png
