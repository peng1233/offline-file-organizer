## Q: Is it offline? Does it upload my files?
A: The organizer runs locally in your browser. It does NOT upload your files to any server.
Your files stay on your machine unless you choose to share the output.

## Q: What do I receive / what is the deliverable?
A: You get:
- A ready-to-run offline ZIP (HTML + JS) you can open locally
- A simple usage guide
- Optional: a customized version based on your folder rules

## Q: Can you customize it to my workflow?
A: Yes. Common customizations:
- Naming rules for folders/files
- CSV manifest format (columns/order)
- Extra safety checks before overwrite
- Presets for common project types

## Q: Will this work on Windows?
A: Yes. It is designed for Windows users. If you can open a browser, you can run it.

## Q: Do you need remote access or my private files?
A: No. If you want help debugging, you can share a small anonymized sample (or just the folder structure).

## Q: How do updates/support work?
A: I can provide a fixed version (new ZIP) and clear release notes. For ongoing support, we can agree on a small maintenance plan.

## Q: Can I use it for client work / commercial use?
A: Yes. You can use it in your own workflow and for client deliveries. If you need a specific license note in your contract, tell me.
