A fully offline, zero-install file organizer that runs in your browser: bulk rename files using templates and export a CSV manifest for tracking/delivery.

## Description (aim <= 1,200 chars)
Need to rename and deliver lots of files fast - without uploading anything?

I will deliver a **100% offline** file organizing tool (HTML) that runs in your browser:
- Batch rename files using a naming template
- Preview changes before download
- Export or copy a **CSV manifest** for delivery / tracking
- Optional: download everything as a ZIP (with a Lite fallback if ZIP isn't available)

Great for:
- Photo/video assets
- Document archiving (contracts, invoices, receipts)
- Privacy-sensitive workflows (intranet / no server uploads)

What I need from you:
- Sample filenames/folders (can be anonymized)
- Your naming rules (e.g., Project_YYYYMMDD_###)

Delivery includes:
- Ready-to-use offline HTML tool + quickstart
- (Optional) customization: templates, conflict rules, export columns, presets

## FAQ (copy/paste)
Q: Do my files get uploaded?
A: No. The tool runs locally in your browser. Your files stay on your device.

Q: What if ZIP download doesn't work in my environment?
A: There is a Lite fallback mode that still supports rename planning + CSV export, and downloads files one-by-one.

Q: Can you match my exact naming convention?
A: Yes. Share your naming rule and a few examples and I'll implement it.
