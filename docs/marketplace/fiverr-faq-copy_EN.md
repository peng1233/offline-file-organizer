# Fiverr FAQ (copy/paste)

These are short FAQ items you can paste into Fiverr's FAQ section.
Keep answers short and clear. All text is ASCII.

## 1) Does this tool upload my files?
No. It runs locally in your browser. Your files stay on your machine.

## 2) Do I need to install anything?
No installation required. You can open the HTML file directly, or run a local localhost server for best browser compatibility.

## 3) What do I receive after delivery?
Typically: a ZIP containing the offline tool (HTML/CSS/JS) plus a short README, and any agreed demo assets (PNG/GIF).

## 4) Can you customize the rename rules?
Yes. Tell me your naming rules (examples are best), and I can add or adjust templates/logic.

## 5) Will it rename my original files?
No. It generates new names and downloads copies (or a ZIP) with the new names. Your originals are not modified.

## 6) Does it support CSV output?
Yes. It can export a CSV rename list, and Lite supports Copy CSV (with fallback if clipboard permissions are blocked).

## 7) What browsers are supported?
Modern Chromium browsers work best. If a browser blocks folder access on file://, use localhost mode.

## 8) Do you need remote access or my private files?
No. I can work from example filenames or a sample CSV. Remote access is optional and only if you explicitly request it.

## 9) Is it fully offline?
Yes. The Lite version is fully offline-capable (no third-party dependencies).

## 10) How many revisions are included?
Depends on the package. A common setup is 1-2 revision rounds for naming rule tweaks.

## Notes (do not paste into Fiverr)
- Avoid any off-platform payment language.
- If Fiverr limits the FAQ length, trim answers to one sentence.
