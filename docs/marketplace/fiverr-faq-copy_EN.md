## FAQ

### Q: Is this really offline? Will my files be uploaded?
A: Yes, it runs locally in your browser. Your files stay on your computer. I do not receive your files unless you explicitly send them.

### Q: What exactly will you deliver?
A: You will get an offline-capable web tool (HTML + JS) that helps you preview a folder/file list and export it as CSV/TSV. Optional add-ons: ZIP packaging, custom columns, and small UI improvements.

### Q: What do you need from me to start?
A: One of the following:
- A short description of your folder structure + what you want to export, or
- A sample file/folder list (text) or a screenshot (no private file contents needed)

### Q: Can you add custom columns or rename fields?
A: Yes. Tell me the columns you want (for example: name, path, size, type, modified time, tags, owner) and the output format (CSV or TSV).

### Q: Can you support Windows / Mac / Linux?
A: Yes. The tool runs in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox). For fully offline usage, I can also provide a Lite fallback version.

### Q: Can you integrate with my existing workflow (Excel / Google Sheets / Notion)?
A: Yes. CSV/TSV export is designed to import cleanly into spreadsheets and many tools. If you tell me your target app, I can tune headers/delimiters.

### Q: Do you offer support after delivery?
A: Yes. I can fix issues and do small adjustments after you test it. The exact number of revisions depends on the package you choose.

### Q: What if I have sensitive data?
A: You can test everything locally without sharing the files. If debugging requires examples, you can provide a sanitized sample list.

## Notes

- Keep answers short on Fiverr. You can trim each answer to 1-2 sentences.
- If you want stronger privacy wording, use: "Runs locally in your browser. No upload. No server.".
