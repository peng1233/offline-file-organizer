# One-pager (short) - Offline File Organizer (EN)

A tiny offline-first web tool that helps you list a folder (files + subfolders), preview it, and export a clean CSV/TSV for Excel/Google Sheets/Notion.

## What it does

- Runs locally in your browser (offline-capable). No server required.
- Preview a folder/file list quickly.
- Export as CSV/TSV (copy/paste or download).
- Optional: package a ready-to-run ZIP for delivery.

## Why it is useful

- Create an inventory of a project folder for reporting.
- Hand off a folder listing to a client without sharing the files.
- Build a spreadsheet-ready index for workflows.

## Deliverables (typical)

- A working offline-capable HTML+JS tool (plus a Lite fallback if needed).
- A demo ZIP you can run on Windows/Mac/Linux (any modern browser).
- Small adjustments (columns, headers, delimiter, extra fields) based on your needs.

## Privacy

- Your files stay on your computer.
- Nothing is uploaded unless you explicitly send something.
