# Offline File Organizer — short one‑pager (EN, 100–200 words)

**Offline File Organizer** is a privacy‑first, fully offline tool to batch rename files and export a clear CSV mapping for review/approval.

- Works **offline** in your browser (no upload, no tracking)
- Generate a rename plan — **Export CSV** or **Copy CSV** (with graceful fallback)
- Optional ZIP download; **Lite** mode is a no‑dependency fallback
- Windows friendly: double‑click `lite\\open.cmd` or follow `docs/windows-quickstart.md`

**Typical delivery** (if you hire me):
1) Adjust rules to your naming standard (prefix/suffix/replace)
2) Add a small enhancement you need (validation, presets, extra export)
3) Provide a reproducible demo + acceptance checklist
