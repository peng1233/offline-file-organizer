# Offline File Organizer - 30-second pitch (copy/paste)

Offline File Organizer is a privacy-first tool that helps people clean up messy folders and rename/sort files **fully offline** (no uploads, no cloud dependency). It's designed for real-world workflows: you can preview changes, apply rules consistently, and keep everything on your own machine.

Best for:
- freelancers/teams handling client documents
- creators managing lots of media files
- anyone who wants repeatable organization without sharing data

If you want a custom workflow (rules, naming scheme, or a tailored one-click organizer for your folder structure), I can deliver it as a small project with clear scope and acceptance checks.
