# Offline File Organizer (Lite) — one‑pager (short)

**Headline (copy/paste):**
Privacy-first *offline* file organizer that generates a previewable catalog + CSV/TSV manifest in your browser.

**What it does (80–120 words):**
Offline File Organizer helps you quickly build a clean inventory of files/folders without uploading anything to a server. You open a local web page, select a folder (or drag & drop), and it generates a human-friendly preview list plus a spreadsheet-ready manifest (CSV and TSV). It’s designed for Windows users who want to organize, archive, migrate, or hand off project folders to teammates/clients. A built-in Demo Mode lets you try it instantly, even if your browser blocks folder access. Optional ZIP support is available (when supported by the browser), with a fully-offline Lite fallback.
