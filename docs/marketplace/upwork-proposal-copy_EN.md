# Upwork Proposal Copy (EN) - Offline File Organizer (Lite)

Use this as copy-paste text for Upwork **job proposals** (not Project Catalog).

Principles:
- Keep everything on Upwork (no off-platform payments).
- Ask 2-3 clarifying questions.
- Offer a small, safe first step (inventory CSV) and then a plan.

## Proposal (short)
Hi {client_name},

I can help you organize {target_area} safely using a fully-offline workflow. First I generate a clear file inventory (CSV), then I propose a folder structure + naming rules. If you want, we can apply the plan only after you approve it.

A few quick questions:
1) OS: Windows or macOS?
2) What is the folder path / rough size (files count or GB)?
3) Your preferred structure: by year/month, by type, or by project/client?

If you reply with those 3 items, I can send a 1-page plan + a checklist for the first run.

Thanks,
{your_name}

## Proposal (more specific: messy Downloads)
Hi {client_name},

I can turn a messy Downloads folder into a clean structure without risky automation.

My process:
1) Inventory: export a CSV list (name/path/size/date/type)
2) Plan: propose folders + naming rules + duplicates handling
3) Apply (optional): only after your approval; reversible approach

Questions:
- Do you want to keep originals (recommended) or move files?
- Any rules like "Invoices by year" / "Photos by date" / "Client-project folders"?

If you share the target folder path + your rules, I will start with the inventory step.

## Quick follow-up message (after you applied)
Delivered:
- CSV inventory
- Organization plan (folders + rules)

Next step:
If you approve, I can apply the plan in a safe, reversible way and provide a short handover note so you can repeat it later.

## FAQ (quick)
Q: Is it offline? Does it upload my files?
A: It runs locally in your browser and does NOT upload your files to any server.

Q: What do I receive / what is the deliverable?
A: A ready-to-run offline ZIP (HTML + JS) + a simple usage guide. Optional: a customized version based on your folder rules.

Q: Do you need remote access or my private files?
A: No. If needed, you can share a small anonymized sample (or just the folder structure) for debugging.
