## Short tagline (1 line)
Open-source tools that make file cleanup and naming fast, offline, and safe.

## About (long)
I maintain **offline-file-organizer**: a practical, offline-first toolkit to clean up and rename files, export results, and keep workflows reproducible.

If the project saves you time (or makes your work less annoying), consider sponsoring to support:
- Maintenance and bug fixes
- Better docs, templates, and demos
- Small automation scripts that reduce friction for real users

## What sponsors get
- Priority on bug reports that include steps to reproduce
- Early access to new templates and copy/paste assets (Fiverr/Upwork/Docs)
- A public thank-you (optional)

Thank you! Reply with your top 1 pain point (rename rules / CSV export / Windows usage / docs). I will prioritize it.

Thanks for supporting as a team. Send your use case and sample folder structure (anonymized) and I will propose an improvement plan.

## FAQ
Q: Can you implement a custom feature for my company?

A: Yes - optional BTC tip page is linked above.

Q: Can I sponsor anonymously?
A: Yes (GitHub supports private sponsorship settings).
