## Short profile (copy/paste)

Hi, I'm maintaining **Offline File Organizer** - a privacy-first, offline-first file utility you can run directly in your browser.

- No upload: your files stay on your machine.
- Batch preview file/folder lists, export CSV/TSV.
- Optional ZIP packaging.
- Includes a fully-offline Lite demo: https://peng1233.github.io/offline-file-organizer/lite/

If this project saves you time, please consider sponsoring.
