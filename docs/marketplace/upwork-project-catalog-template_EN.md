## Title

[Example: Offline File Organizer (Privacy-first) + CSV Export + Optional ZIP Packaging]

## Category / Skills

- Category: [e.g., Data Processing / Automation]
- Skills (tags): [JavaScript] [Data Cleaning] [Automation] [CSV] [Web App]

## Project summary (short)

[2-3 sentences. Who is it for + what you deliver + why it is safe/private.]

Example:
This is a privacy-first offline tool that helps you batch preview file/folder lists, export to CSV/TSV, and optionally package outputs as a ZIP. Runs in your browser - no upload required.

## What the client provides

- [A folder of files] or [a ZIP] or [a sample directory structure]
- [Rules for naming / filtering / columns]
- [Expected output format: CSV/TSV/ZIP]

## What I will deliver

- A working offline organizer (browser-based) configured for your workflow
- Exported CSV/TSV with the columns you request
- Optional ZIP packaging (if needed)
- A short handover note (how to run / how to repeat)

## How it works (process)

1) You share requirements + a small example dataset (or screenshots).
2) I confirm columns/output rules + delivery scope.
3) I run the offline workflow and produce the exports.
4) You review; I apply 1 round of small adjustments.
