## Version A - short (recommended)

Hi [Name],

I build privacy-first, offline tools that run entirely in the browser (no file upload).

One example is **Offline File Organizer**:
- Batch list files/folders, preview, export CSV/TSV, optional ZIP packaging
- Includes a fully-offline Lite demo (for quick evaluation)

Demo (Lite): https://peng1233.github.io/offline-file-organizer/lite/
Repo: https://github.com/peng1233/offline-file-organizer

If you share your workflow (what files you process, desired output format, volume), I can propose a 1-2 day implementation plan and deliver a working version quickly.

Best,
[Your name]

## Version B - problem/solution framing

Hi [Name],

Quick context: many teams need to inspect / sort / export file lists, but cannot upload sensitive data to cloud tools.

I maintain a small open-source tool that runs 100% locally in the browser (offline):
https://peng1233.github.io/offline-file-organizer/lite/

If this matches your use case, I can:
- customize the UI/fields
- add CSV templates / validations
- add workflow-specific export formats

What is your target outcome and constraints (data sensitivity, file count, format)?

Thanks,
[Your name]
