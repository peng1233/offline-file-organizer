# Fiverr gallery captions (copy/paste)

Use these as **image captions / gallery text** (or short descriptions) when you upload screenshots/GIFs.

## Suggested set (3 images)

1) **100% offline & privacy-first**
   - Runs locally in your browser. No uploads. Your files stay on your machine.

2) **Batch preview + export a clean inventory (CSV/TSV)**
   - Quickly list files/folders, preview structure, export a spreadsheet-friendly manifest.

3) **Optional ZIP packaging + Lite fallback demo**
   - Create a ZIP package when needed.
   - If anything breaks, there is a fully-offline Lite demo page to validate the workflow.
   - Lite: https://peng1233.github.io/offline-file-organizer/lite/

## Notes (keep it compliant)

- By default, do **not** include any donation QR code image in your Fiverr gallery.
- If you include external links, keep them informational (demo + GitHub) and follow Fiverr rules.
