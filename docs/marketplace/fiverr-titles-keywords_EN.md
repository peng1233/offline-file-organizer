# Fiverr gig title + keyword ideas (EN)

Goal: make it easy to publish a Fiverr gig fast (copy/paste), while keeping claims honest.

## Title ideas (pick 1)

1) I will build an offline file organizer (batch rename + ZIP) you can run in the browser
2) I will create a privacy-first offline batch file renamer with CSV export (no upload)
3) I will deliver a local-only batch rename tool with preview + rollback CSV manifest
4) I will make a lightweight offline file renaming web app (no server, no data leaving your PC)
5) I will build a simple offline file organizer for freelancers (rename rules + ZIP packaging)
6) I will create a browser-based offline file organizer with batch rename + CSV/TSV export
7) I will deliver an offline batch file rename solution with a fully-offline lite fallback
8) I will build a local-only file organizer MVP (rename rules, preview, export, optional ZIP)
9) I will create an offline file utility for organizing deliverables (rename + package)
10) I will build a privacy-first offline file organizer with demo mode and clear docs

## Keyword / tag ideas (mix 5-10)

- file rename
- batch rename
- file organizer
- offline tool
- privacy
- javascript
- web app
- automation
- csv export
- zip
- workflow
- productivity

## Notes (to avoid Fiverr rejections)

- Avoid absolute promises like "100% works in all browsers". Use: "Works in modern browsers; Lite fallback included".
- Don't mention bypassing platform rules or scraping.
- Keep delivery scope clear: what you deliver + what you need from the buyer (example files/rules).
