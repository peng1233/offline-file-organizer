## Title
Offline File Organizer (privacy-safe) - help you clean up, categorize, and rename messy folders fast

## Professional summary
I build small, practical tools that turn messy folders into clean, searchable, well-named archives - without uploading your files anywhere.

If you have:
- thousands of screenshots / downloads / scanned docs,
- inconsistent file names,
- duplicates and near-duplicates,
- multiple naming standards across teams,

...I can help you define a naming rule, generate a clean plan, and deliver an offline tool + repeatable workflow.

## What I deliver (typical)
- A clear naming standard (examples + edge cases)
- A safe offline workflow (no cloud / no file upload)
- A " preview first\ run (see changes before applying)
- A repeatable process so you can run it monthly/weekly

## Why this approach
- Privacy-first: process happens locally
- Faster iteration: you can validate on a sample folder first
- Easy rollback: we keep logs and you can revert when needed

## Suggested engagement options
- Quick cleanup sprint (1-2 days): define naming rules + run on one folder
- Standard delivery (3-5 days): rules + tool setup + documentation + handoff
- Ongoing maintenance (weekly/monthly): new folders, new rules, team feedback

## Notes (fit / constraints)
- I do not request your private data. If needed, you can provide a sanitized sample folder structure.
- For sensitive files: you run the tool locally; I guide you step-by-step.
