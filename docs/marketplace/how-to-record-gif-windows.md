# How to record a short GIF on Windows (for marketplace demos)

Goal: produce a 10-15s GIF that clearly shows the workflow.

Recommended free tool: ScreenToGif
- Website: https://www.screentogif.com/

## Option A: ScreenToGif (best quality for small GIFs)
1) Install ScreenToGif.
2) Open it and choose **Recorder**.
3) Resize the recording frame to only cover the browser/app area.
4) Record 10-15 seconds.
5) Stop -> the editor opens automatically.
6) (Optional) Remove dead time, speed up 1.2x-1.5x.
7) File -> Save as -> **GIF**.
8) Keep width around 900-1200px for crisp text without huge file size.

## Option B: Windows Xbox Game Bar (records MP4)
If you only need MP4 (some platforms accept MP4 instead of GIF):
1) Press **Win+G** to open Xbox Game Bar.
2) Start recording.
3) Stop recording -> it saves an MP4.
4) Convert MP4 to GIF using ScreenToGif (File -> Open) or an online converter.
