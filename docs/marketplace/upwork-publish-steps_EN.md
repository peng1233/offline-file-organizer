# Upwork publish steps (Project Catalog)

Goal: create a minimal Upwork Project Catalog draft (save as draft first) using the ready-to-copy assets in this repo.

Prereqs (from this repo):
- Links (copy/paste): docs/marketplace/links_EN.md
- Project template: docs/marketplace/upwork-project-catalog-template_EN.md
- Short description (if field is limited): docs/marketplace/service-description-short_EN.md
- Demo assets: docs/assets/lite-demo.png (or lite-demo.gif)
- Optional cover image (generated): docs/assets/fiverr-cover.png

Steps:
1) Open Upwork -> Find Work -> Project Catalog (create a new Project).
2) Title:
   - Use a short, clear title from upwork-project-catalog-template_EN.md.
3) Category / Skills / Tags:
   - Use suggested keywords from docs/marketplace/platform-keywords-tags.md.
4) Project Description:
   - Paste the full description from upwork-project-catalog-template_EN.md.
   - If Upwork restricts external links, keep only: GitHub repo + Demo link(s).
5) Deliverables / Requirements:
   - Copy the Requirements checklist from upwork-project-catalog-template_EN.md.
   - Keep it simple: input folder + naming rules + example.
6) Images:
   - Upload docs/assets/lite-demo.png (recommended).
   - Optional: upload docs/assets/fiverr-cover.png as a clean cover.
7) Price / Timeline:
   - Choose a conservative baseline tier from docs/marketplace/pricing-delivery-tiers.md.
   - Do NOT promise anything you cannot deliver.
8) Preview everything:
   - Ensure text is all ASCII (to avoid mojibake), links are correct, and the demo image displays.
9) Save as DRAFT.
   - Do not click the final publish/submit if it triggers any payment, identity verification, or binding commitments.

Notes:
- Always keep the demo + repo link visible so the buyer can self-verify.
- If you need a 100-200 word bio snippet, use: docs/marketplace/platform-profile-template.md.
