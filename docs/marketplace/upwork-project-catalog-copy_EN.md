# Upwork Project Catalog Copy (EN) — Offline File Organizer (Lite)

Use this as copy-paste text to create an Upwork **Project Catalog** offering.

## Project title (pick one)
1) Offline File Organizer (Lite) setup + customization (Windows-friendly)
2) Build an offline file inventory (CSV) + safe organization plan
3) Organize messy downloads into a clean folder structure (offline tool)

## Short description (1–2 lines)
A fully-offline tool + workflow to inventory and organize local files safely. Includes CSV inventory + an optional “apply plan” step with confirmation.

## What you’ll get (deliverables)
- A ready-to-use offline tool package (Lite HTML + open.cmd)
- A generated CSV inventory of your target folder(s)
- A proposed organization plan (folder structure + naming rules)
- Optional: apply the plan (only after your approval)
- A short handover note (how to run it again)

## What I need from you
- Your OS (Windows/macOS) and preferred folder structure style
- The target folder(s) to organize (path names are enough — do not send sensitive files)
- Any rules (e.g., group by year/month/type, client/project naming, keep originals, etc.)

## FAQ
**Q: Do you need access to my computer?**
Not required. We can work with exported file lists (CSV) and your rules. If you prefer guided steps, I can provide a simple step-by-step checklist.

**Q: Is this safe?**
Yes. Lite runs fully offline. If applying changes, it uses a confirmation step and a reversible approach (we keep originals unless you explicitly request otherwise).

**Q: Can you handle huge folders?**
Yes, but performance depends on disk speed and folder size. I’ll suggest safe batching if needed.
