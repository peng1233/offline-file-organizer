Purpose: paste these into the Fiverr Gig editor "Requirements" (or "Questions") to collect the minimum info needed for a smooth delivery.

Notes:
- Keep everything inside Fiverr (no external contact details).
- If Fiverr enforces a strict max count, start with the first 3 questions.

## What you will receive (delivery)

- A **CSV rename plan** (preview first; nothing is applied until you confirm).
- A short step-by-step guide to apply the rename safely (or I can deliver an updated rule set if you want to run it yourself).

If you want, include 1-2 sample filenames here (without private info) so I can validate the rule quickly.
