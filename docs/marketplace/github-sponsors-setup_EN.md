# GitHub Sponsors setup (quick steps)

Purpose: enable a simple, trustworthy support channel for this repo.

## Before you start

- You need a GitHub account that owns (or has admin on) the repository.
- If you represent an organization, decide whether Sponsors is for the org or a personal account.

## Steps (high level)

1) Open GitHub Sponsors enrollment

- https://github.com/sponsors

2) Choose the sponsored account

- Pick the user/org that should receive sponsorship.

3) Complete required profile fields

- Add a short bio that matches what this project does.
- Add a clear support message (what sponsorship helps with).

4) Set tiers (keep it simple)

Suggested tiers:
- $3 / month: "Support maintenance"
- $10 / month: "Priority fixes (best effort)"
- $25 / month: "Feature requests (best effort)"

Notes:
- Do not promise delivery dates unless you can guarantee them.
- Keep tier names plain ASCII for copy/paste safety.

5) Add a Sponsors call-to-action in the repo

- Ensure README mentions Sponsors link.
- Ensure the BTC tip page is also available for one-time tips.
