## Short description (Fiverr excerpt)

Privacy-first, fully offline file organizer you can run locally in your browser. I will help you set it up, customize output fields, and deliver a ready-to-use package with clear instructions.


## Full description

Need to review and organize lots of local files, but you cannot upload them anywhere?

I will help you use a fully offline, privacy-first file organizer (runs locally in your browser, no server) and tailor it to your workflow.

What you get:
- A ready-to-use offline package (Lite version) you can open on Windows with one click
- Batch preview + export a CSV/TSV manifest (for audit, reporting, or follow-up processing)
- Optional ZIP packaging step (if your environment supports it)
- Clear, simple instructions (Windows-focused)

Why offline:
- Your files stay on your machine
- No accounts, no cloud upload, no tracking

Deliverables:
- Customized Lite build (HTML/JS files) or a configured usage guide
- CSV/TSV manifest example and recommended fields
- Optional: a small automation script (PowerShell) to run repeatably

Demo:
- Main demo: https://peng1233.github.io/offline-file-organizer/
- Lite demo (fully offline): https://peng1233.github.io/offline-file-organizer/lite/

Important:
- I do NOT need your private files. You can test locally.
- If you want customization, please provide a sample folder structure and a list of fields you want in the export.


## Packages (suggested)

Basic (Setup)
- Help you run Lite locally on Windows
- Configure export fields (basic)
- Delivery: instructions + a ready-to-open folder

Standard (Workflow)
- Everything in Basic
- Add a repeatable checklist and recommended naming/output conventions
- Provide a template CSV manifest and validation notes

Premium (Customization)
- Everything in Standard
- Small UI tweaks (labels/buttons), extra export fields, or a custom output preset
- Optional: add a safe "demo mode" dataset for internal training


## Requirements (copy/paste)

1) Your goal in 1-2 sentences (what outcome you want)
2) Windows version (or Mac/Linux)
3) Do you need CSV, TSV, or both?
4) List the fields you want in the manifest (examples: relative path, size, last modified, tags)
5) If customization is needed: a NON-sensitive example folder tree (text only) and your naming rules


## FAQ (copy/paste)

Q: Do I need to upload my files?
A: No. The Lite tool runs fully offline in your browser. Your files stay local.

Q: Can you guarantee ZIP packaging works?
A: It depends on the browser environment and local permissions. If ZIP is not available, you can still export a CSV/TSV manifest and organize locally.

Q: Can you add custom fields or change the export format?
A: Yes, within reasonable scope. Tell me what columns you need.

Q: Can you automate it?
A: Yes. I can provide a small PowerShell helper for repeatable runs on Windows.
