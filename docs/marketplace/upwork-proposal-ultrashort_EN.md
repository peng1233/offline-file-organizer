# Upwork Proposal (ultra-short, paste-safe)

Use when the client wants a quick first reply. Keep it friendly + specific.

## Variant A (privacy/offline)

Hi! I can deliver an offline, browser-based file organizer/renamer that runs locally (no upload). You'll get: (1) rename preview + conflict checks, (2) CSV export/copy of the plan, (3) optional ZIP download or per-file download fallback, (4) Windows one-command launcher.

If you share 2-3 sample filenames + your rule (pattern/replace), I'll send a working demo + checklist within 24h.

## Variant B (speed/automation)

Hi! I can help you batch-rename/organize files fast. Deliverable: a simple offline tool + a reproducible rename plan (CSV) so you can audit results before applying. Works on Windows/macOS in the browser.

Reply with: your target naming format + 5 example files, and I'll propose the exact rules + timeline.

## Variant C (300-400 chars, maximum concise)

Hi! I can build an offline (no-upload) browser tool to batch-rename your files with preview + conflict checks, and export/copy the rename plan as CSV. Optional ZIP download, with per-file fallback. Share 5 sample names + your rule, and I'll send a working demo + checklist within 24h.

## Variant D (200-250 chars, inventory-first)

Hi! I can organize your files with a fully-offline workflow (no uploads). Step 1: export a CSV inventory (name/path/size/date/type). Step 2: propose folders + naming rules. Step 3 (optional): apply only after you approve.
