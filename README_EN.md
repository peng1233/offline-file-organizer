# Offline File Organizer (Batch Rename + ZIP)

A tiny offline tool that runs 100% locally in your browser:
- Select multiple files
- Batch rename with simple rules
- Download everything as a ZIP

Privacy: no uploads. Works offline.

## How to use
Open `index.html`.

## Fully-offline fallback (Lite)
If your environment can't load third-party libraries or can't generate ZIPs, use the Lite version:
- Entry: `lite/index.html`
- Features: no external deps; batch rename; download one-by-one; export a CSV manifest; ZIP is optional.
